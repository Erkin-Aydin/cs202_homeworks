# cs202_homeworks
My submissions to homeworks assignments of CS202 course of İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2021-2022 Spring Semester. 

It should be noted that this is shared purely to support students' "ACADEMIC" learning process of subjects in this course, not for them to "PLAGIARIZE" their assignments.
These assignments can be used as references to small problems in your code, for example, if you didn't understand a small proportion of an algorithm in the course, it is likely
that I've implemented it here, with its good and bads. You can use my code to understand the algorithm better. Or, for example, if you do not know how to write a Makefile, you can look mine.

Copy pasting the code is a different thing though. If you are planning to ctrl+c ctrl+v some code, just drop the course. These topics are important, try to actually learn them. You deserve better than stealing.
