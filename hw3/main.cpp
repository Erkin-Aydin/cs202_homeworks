/*
* Title: Heaps, Priority Queues
* Author: Erkin AydÄ±n
* ID: 22002956
* Section: 2
* Assignment: 3
* Description: This is the source file that simulation happens. A clock signal is mocked by an integer value. we start
 * simulating with 1 computer, then we increase the number of computers each time the average waiting time is higher than
 * the wished one. We stop when average waiting time is lower than or equal to the entered one through the command line.
 * A Little Note: There may be, and probably are, better ways to convert strings to integers, however I chose to convert
 * it by using c-type strings as I found it interesting.
